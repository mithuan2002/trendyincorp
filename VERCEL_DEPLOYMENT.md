# Vercel Deployment Guide for Trendy Incorp

## Quick Fix for Blank Page Issue

Your project is now properly configured for Vercel deployment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (if using database features)
- `NODE_ENV`: production

### 2. Deploy Commands
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (already configured)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public` (already configured)

### 3. Root Directory
Set your root directory to `.` (current directory) in Vercel settings.

### 4. Node.js Version
Ensure Vercel is using Node.js 18 or higher.

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Vercel Configuration**: Updated `vercel.json` with proper rewrites instead of routes
✅ **HTML Meta Tags**: Added proper title and description, removed Replit scripts
✅ **Serverless API**: Created proper API functions in `/api/index.ts`
✅ **Database Storage**: Configured production database storage
✅ **Build Process**: Verified successful builds with all assets

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Push your changes and redeploy
2. **Check Browser Console**: If still blank, open browser dev tools to see any JavaScript errors
3. **Test API**: Visit `your-domain.vercel.app/api/health` to verify API is working

## Troubleshooting

If you still see a blank page:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel
3. Ensure you're deploying the latest code with these fixes

Your Trendy Incorp website should now load properly on Vercel!
